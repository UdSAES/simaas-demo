This repository contains the code used for demonstrating the capabilities of the https://github.com/UdSAES/simaas-api[cloud-native _simulation as a service_-implementation] developed at the https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/frey.html[chair of automation and energy systems] at Saarland university.

== Installation
Clone the repository, then install the dependencies (specified in `Pipfile`/`Pipfile.lock`) into a new https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[Pipenv]-environment using `pipenv install`.

=== Configuration
All environment variables without a default value MUST be set before starting the program. Otherwise, a fatal error will be raised and the program will terminate with a non-zero exit code.

For example, the ENVVARs can be set by putting `export SIMAAS_*=...`-statements in a file named `.env` and then loading the contents of this file via `source .env`.

|===
| Environment Variable
| Description
| Default Value

| `UC1D_SIMAAS_ORIGIN`
| The origin of the URL identifying/locating simulation as a service-instance. Make sure that this can be resolved from the `simaas-worker`-instances (i.e. don't use `localhost` if running containers)!
| --

| `UC1D_POLLING_RETRIES`
| The maximum number of retries for polling the status of a simulation (parsed as integer)
| `30`

| `UC1D_POLLING_FREQUENCY`
| The time between to retries for polling the status of a simulation in seconds (parsed as float)
| `0.1`

| `UC1D_LOG_LEVEL`
| The minimal included https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/logger.html#levels[log level] that shall be printed
| `INFO`

| `UC1D_EFC_FMU`
| The path to the FMU used for the ensemble PV forecast
| --

| `UC1D_GA_FMU`
| The path to the FMU used for the parameter fitting-example using a genetic algorithm
| --

| `UC1D_WEATHER_FROM_DISK`
| Load the weather data from `./weather_forecast.csv` if `true`; request from API otherwise
| `true`

| `UC1D_WEATHER_API_ORIGIN`
| The origin of the URL identifying/locating an instance of the https://github.com/UdSAES/dwd_data_access[dwd_data_access-API]; e.g.: `https://weather.nibbler.msaas.me`
| -- footnote:[This is _not_ necessary iff `UC1D_WEATHER_FROM_DISK` is `true`!]

| `UC1D_WEATHER_API_JWT`
| The JSON web token for authentication with the https://github.com/UdSAES/dwd_data_access[dwd_data_access-API]
| `None`

== Usage
[source,sh]
----
# Activate virtual environment
pipenv shell

# List available demos
invoke -c demo --list

# Load ENVVARs and run demo
source .env; invoke -c demo demo-efc
----

...

== Development
[source,sh]
----
isort .  # ensure that `import`-statements are consistently sorted
black .  # format all Python code files using Black
